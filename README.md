SkLearn Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations using Python.
Each project file focuses on a different Machine Learning model.

Project 1: Classification with K-nearest Neighbors 
Project 2: Perceptrons
Project 3: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression 
Project 4: Reccomender Systems
Project 5: Clustering 

The final project files (CS 305-Final and CS 305_Final Project_DATA_CLEANING) investigate how various features of a movie (director, runtime, censor rating, etc.) affect viewership. We determine  which of these factors is the most influential in a filmâ€™s box office revenue and viewer ratings.
