    "Fake news is news that intentionally spreads misinformation, information that is not accurate or misleading. Two people might read the same story and one might consider it to be real while the other understands it to be fake, and this all depends on their perception of the news which is usually tied to their political stance. Examples of this include someone who is far-right reading a website that promotes far-right ideologies and considering it \"real\" while someone who is left-leaning might read that same website and consider it to be \"fake\". \n",

    "Fake news can be combatted using machine learning algoirthms. Such algoirthms can be trained to detect fake news by looking at some features such as  headlines not matching the body, or too many capital letters in a headline, and cross-checking stories with ann official database of thousands of legitimate and fake stories. Some other ways to combat fake news is by allowing users to be able to report when they consider news they read online to be fake, and this data could be used to build other databases for machine learning. Allowing real humans to be able to flag might allow for algoirthms to account for political or general human biases. Another way is to follow EU laws on transparency and make sure that each posted article has verified sources from a pre-determined database of legitimate sources. One final way is to make sure that fake news is not spread as much is by making sure there is a vetting process when releasing important articles, such as news organization cross checking with other news organizations. \n"

Hint: the <code>sklearn</code> function <code>random.shuffle</code> may be useful. However, if you shuffle the two arrays independently then labels in the <code>y</code> array won't correspond to the feature vectors in the <code>X</code> array. As an alternative, one approach is to combine the two arrays into a single array (e.g., with the <code>numpy</code> function either <code>hstack</code> or <code>concatenate</code>), randomly shuffle this array, and then split the array back into two arrays <code>X</code> and <code>y</code>.</P>"
